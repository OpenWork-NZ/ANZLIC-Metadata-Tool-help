## Overview
### Background 
1. Purpose - ICSM and EMCINA
    1. Commissioned by GA and EMCINA to support the creation and editing of ISO19115-3 metadata following the guidance developed by MDWG

            1. 5 year (?) gap with no tool - Guidance came first. Tool aligns with guidance
        1. Guidance developed by the MDWG
            1. Alignment with through Layout, Thesaurus, Managed directories (Explain & List)
            1. Help Links to guidance
        1. About previous ANZMet Lite

            1. Windows only 
            1. Not opensource
            1. Not flexible

            1. template based
            1. In house modifications allowed
    1. Technical underpinnings
        1. Built on GN 3.10.6
            1. Bug fixes and other changes pushed to core and will be available in future versions
            1. Can work with current GN ISO19115-3 Databases 
        1. GN Editor changes only
            1. No changes to the viewer or other metadata standards (save hiding the map interface)
        1. Supports ICSM guidance ISO 19115-3 
            1. As a Replacement Schema for the default ISO 19115-3
            1. Not yet fully compatible with schema plug-in process
        1. Managed directories
            1. Better ISO19115-3 support for responsible party (Includes identifier support)
